# Welcome Telegram Bot

Simple bot that greets new users.

It includes some basic rules for expulsion based on name and in captcha
resolution.

The new user won't be able to write anything until the captcha is resolved,
then there will be a time of limited use (will only be able to send text).

Greetings are grouped if there is no activity in the chat and are not given by 
the bot if another member does it, for which it has a timer.
